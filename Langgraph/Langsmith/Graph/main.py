    Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is the branch of physics that studies
    the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles.
    Unlike classical physics, which follows predictable laws of motion, quantum physics reveals
    a world governed by probabilities and uncertainties. One of its central principles is the
    wave-particle duality, which shows that particles like electrons and photons can behave both
    as waves and particles depending on how they are observed. Another key concept, Heisenbergâ€™s
    uncertainty principle, states that certain properties, such as position and momentum, cannot
    both be measured with complete precision at the same time.
    
    Despite its abstract and sometimes puzzling concepts, quantum physics has had profound practical
    impacts on technology and modern life. The development of semiconductors, which are the foundation
    of computers and smartphones, relies on quantum mechanics. Other technologies, such as lasers,
    magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and even the emerging field of quantum computing, stem directly
    from quantum principles.
